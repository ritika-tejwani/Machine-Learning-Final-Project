# CSE 417 Intro to Machine Learning: Final ProjectT
This was the final project for an Intro to Machine Learning class at WashU in SP2023. I worked with two of my classmates to design, implement, and test three different machine learning models on a high-dimension, non-linearly separable dataset. The red wine dataset has 12 attributes, 11 of which are input variables: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol; one of which is the target variable: quality. 

We decided to apply a logistic regression, random forest classifier, and support vector machine algorithm on the red wine dataset due to their varying levels of complexity and unique approaches to classification with the goal of optimal classification performance on this dataset in mind. For each approach, we also implemented various measures to improve performance such as data scaling and exhaustive hyperparameter evaluation. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that a tuned random forest classifier model clearly performs the strongest on this dataset.
